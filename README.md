## Self Evaluation
* Functionality
  * The functionality in my Enigma project meets expectations. The encrypt/decrypt methods work as intended. Also, the command line interface is fully implemented. I was not able to complete the crack method in the Enigma class and therefore I do not deserve my score to meet above expectations for functionality.

* Object Oriented Programming
  * My project meets expectations for OOP according to the rubric. No class is too long or too short. And each class contains information that only it should know about. I really tried to focus on single responsibility for this project and I think I did an okay job with it.

* Ruby Conventions and Mechanics
  * I did not do this best job with this section. I think over all I am below expectations in this section. I use `.map` a few times and `.each_with_index`, but no other enumerables. I also never found an appropriate spot for a Hash in the project. Things I did well in this section include indentation, spacing, and not having lines that are too long. I did alright with naming, but I could have done a better job. If my encryption and decryption classes we a little better, I would say I meet expectations, especially if I found a spot for a hash in these classes.

* Test Driven Development
  * When I start a project, I really focus on testing. There are tests that include stubs for randomness and date, but I am still practicing stubs so I am not sure if it was done properly in the offset class. Besides that, I tested every method, and coverage is at 100%. I think I meet expectations for testing with my project.

* Overall thoughts
  * I think I met most expectations of this project. I always critique my work harshly. I would call my encryption/decryption classes creative, but I am sure there is a better way to create the methods I used in these classes. Also, I think everything could have been organized a little better. I struggled a little but with organization and changed things back and forth several times. The Enigma class could have been organized much better, especially with what this class gets instantiated with.
